Previously, bouml would install itself into /usr. I changed it
to install under /tmp, since its a place that is acessible and
it is suitable for volatile testing purposes. Calling make install
under this folder will compile and install bouml-ng and put the
results under /tmp. To execute, use /tmp/bin/bouml.

Thanks.
